<H1> Some tutorial Matlab neural network programs </H1>

Here are a few extensively commented Matlab programs
that I wrote, which
I hope might be useful for teaching a course
on how to program neural nets.
Please feel free to
<A HREF="mailto:raizada at cornell dot edu">mail me</A> with any
questions or comments.

<ul>
<li>
<A href="Matlab/Neural_nets/bkprop.m"> <b> bkprop.m</b></A> -
This program shows step-by-step how to write classic
Rumelhart & McClelland backprop using just matrices and vectors.
This code might be useful for teaching the basic structure of the
backprop
algorithm, or for showing how to avoid for-loops by vectorising.
I posted this code to the newsgroup 
<a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?group=comp.ai.neural-nets"
target="_blank">comp.ai.neural-nets</a>
and it was subsequently 
<a href="http://www.cs.stir.ac.uk/courses/31YF/Handouts/Practicals/bp.m"
target="_blank">used for teaching in a course</a>
at the University of Stirling.

<li>
<A href="Matlab/Neural_nets/sofm.m">
<b> sofm.m</b></A> - This program shows how a Self-Organising
Feature Map (or SOFM, also often called a Kohonen map) can learn
a particular input distribution, in this case a letter 'A'.

<li>
<A href="Matlab/Neural_nets/fuzzyartmap_demo.m">
<b> fuzzyartmap_demo.m</b></A> - This program shows graphically how
Fuzzy ARTMAP learns the circle-in-the-square task by growing
category boxes in response to the presented inputs. Detailed comments
explain the algorithm's match, reset and learning stages.
