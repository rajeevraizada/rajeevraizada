The actual math of this is just multiplying and adding. The multiplying part is: we go along the stimulus-time-series vector, element by element, and we multiply each element by the HRF. e.g. if the vector starts off: [ 0, 0, 1, 0, ... ] then we take multiply: 0* HRF, then 0* HRF, then 1* HRF, then 0* HRF etc.\n","\n","We then take those multiplied HRFs and add them all together, to make an output vector that is the result of the convolution.\n","\n","The only extra consideration is that each HRF gets \"kicked off\", i.e. multiplied and added, at a different position along the stimulus-time-series vector.
