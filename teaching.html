<h2> Matlab and Python tutorials for fMRI, statistics and neural networks </h2>

Here are links to some online tutorials that I wrote, using
Matlab and Python. The code is designed to be readable, and it contains lots
of comments which explain what is going on. As well as running the code to
see the tutorials in action, look at the code itself to see read the
explanations provided in the comments.

<h2> BCS 513: Introduction to fMRI: Imaging, Computational Analysis & Neural Representations </h2>

<iframe align=right title="YouTube video player" width="350" height="250"

The core focus of course BCS 513 is on how fMRI can be used to ask questions about neural representations and cognitive and perceptual information processing. There is a particular emphasis on neural decoding and multivoxel pattern analysis methods. The course is mostly intended for graduate students, but is also open to interested undergrads.

<h2>BCS 265: Language and the Brain </h2>

This undergraduate class covers the neural processes and representations involved in language processing, and how they relate to linguistic behaviour. As part of the class, students find journal articles that they would like to present to the class, meet with me to go over their draft slides, and then give their presentation. Practicing how to convey the key points of a topic in an engaging manner is probably as important an aspect of this class as is the actual brain and language content.

<h2>BCS 508: Cognitive Neuroscience </h2>

The aim of BCS 508 is to provide a general introduction
to neuroscientific studies of various aspects of human cognition and
perception, e.g. object-recognition, development, attention, language,
vision, etc.
<br>
<br>
The class consists both of lectures (by me, and also a variety of
guest lecturers from within the department) and also seminar-type
discussions led by the students.
