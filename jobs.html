There are no current openings in my lab. However, there may well be 
some openings in the future, so please feel free to 
<A HREF="mailto:rajeev dot raizada at gmail dot com">contact me</A> if you are 
potentially interested in a Research Assistant, grad student or postdoc 
position that might be starting a year or two from now.

<!--
 | I am currently recruiting graduate students and two postdocs for my lab at 
 | Rochester. 
 | <A HREF="mailto:rajeev dot raizada at gmail dot com">
 | Contact me</A> if you are interested to learn more!
 | <br>
 | <br>
 | Details about the two postdoc positions are as follows:
 | <br>
 | <br>
 | Two postdoctoral positions are available in the Department of Brain &
 | Cognitive Sciences at the University of Rochester in the lab of Rajeev
 | Raizada (<a href="http://raizadalab.org">raizadalab.org</a>).
 | <br>
 | <br>
 | Both positions will involve applying multivoxel pattern-based fMRI
 | analysis to seeking to understand the structure of neural
 | representations. One position will concentrate especially on the
 | neural decoding of language, in particular the semantic representation
 | of words embedded in sentences. The other position will focus on
 | exploring similarity-based representations, relating neural similarity
 | structure to the visual and semantic similarity of objects.
 | <br>
 | <br>
 | Applicants must have a PhD in neuroscience, psychology, linguistics,
 | computer science or a related field. Experience in some or all of the
 | following areas would be ideal: fMRI data analysis, machine learning
 | (especially kernel-based or Bayesian approaches), computational
 | linguistics (for the language decoding postdoc), computer vision or
 | visual psychophysics (for the object-similarity postdoc). Experience
 | with Matlab or some other scientific programming language (e.g. SciPy,
 | R) is required.
 | <br>
 | <br>
 | Salary will be on the standard NIH postdoc payscale. Both positions
 | are available immediately and have funding for a two year period,
 | although they could potentially be extended beyond that time if
 | mutually agreed and if additional funding is obtained.
 | <br>
 | <br>
 | To apply, please send a description of your research interests, a CV,
 | the names of three referees, and weblinks to representative
 | publications to rajeev dot raizada at gmail dot com , specifying in the
 | subject-line which of the two positions you are applying to. Large
 | files such as PDFs of papers should be sent as weblinks (e.g. to your
 | publications webpage, or using Dropbox) rather than as e.mail
 | attachments. If you will be attending the upcoming Society for
 | Neuroscience conference then it might be possible to meet there,
 | otherwise interviews can be conducted via Skype.
 | <br>
 | <br>
 | The <a href="http://www.bcs.rochester.edu">Department of Brain & Cognitive Sciences</a> at the University of
 | Rochester has a strong focus on
 | computational and statistical studies of neural representations, and
 | has researchers working in language, vision, computation, development
 | and neuroimaging. The <a href="http://rcbi.rochester.edu">Rochester Center for Brain Imaging</a> has a research-dedicated 3T Siemens Trio
 | scanner.
