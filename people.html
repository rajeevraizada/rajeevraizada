I am an 
Assistant Professor in the <A HREF="http://www.bcs.rochester.edu/" target="_blank">
Department of Brain & Cognitive Sciences</A> at the 
University of Rochester. 
<BR>
<BR>
My research uses pattern-based fMRI analysis (also sometimes referred to as multi-voxel pattern analysis, or MVPA): applying methods from machine learning to study distributed multivoxel activation patterns in the brain. Although such methods have recently become popular for "decoding" neural signals, my own work aims to move beyond that, by seeking to uncover the structure of neural representations, and their relations to individual differences in behaviour. I am also very interested in relating these more theoretical questions to real-world problems, especially those of learning difficulties and educational disadvantage.

Donias is a recent graduate from the University of Rochester with a B.S. in neuroscience. He is interested in expanding his knowledge of research by gaining more experience in the field of cognitive science, before eventually applying to a graduate program, possibly for a MD/PhD. His interests have taken him from the cellular aspect of the brain by working in an Alzheimer's lab, to the conceptual aspect of the brain by working in a language processing lab, to now focusing on neural representation studies through fMRI analysis.
