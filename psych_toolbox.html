<H1> Some tutorial Matlab Psychophysics Toolbox programs </H1>

The
<a href="http://www.psychtoolbox.org/" target="_blank">
Matlab Psychophysics Toolbox</a>, written by David Brainard and Denis Pelli,
is a wonderful package for presenting stimuli.
It allows Matlab programs to call low-level videocard
and timing routines which provide extremely accurate
control. It runs on Mac OS 9 and Windows, with Mac OS X and Linux
on the way soon.
I have used it for presenting visual,
auditory and cross-modal stimuli, for psychophysical
testing and for fMRI presentation.
<br>
<br>
Below are some programs that show how
to present flickering log-polar radial checkerboards, rotating
wedges and expanding rings using Colour Look-Up Tables (CLUTs).
The nice thing about CLUTs is that they let you
change what's on the screen without needing
to do any time-consuming re-drawing of pixels.
You can just change the colour of the pixels
that are already there, in less than the blink of an eye.
These programs also show how to present stimuli
with frame-accurate timing.

to see the flashing checkerboards in action. 
To run it, you also need the .mat file containing
the matrix that defines the checkerboards,

clut_check_pic.mat</a>, and the program that makes the CLUTS:

<A HREF="http://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/~raj/make_check_for_clut.m" 
target="_blank">
make_check_for_clut.m</A> - This program shows how
the matrix stored in clut_check_pic.mat was made. 
If you download that .mat file then you don't
need to run this program. However, if you're curious to see
how to make a log-polar radial checkboard, then take a look!

If you want to see more that the PsychToolbox can do,
then a very good tutorial program is MinimalExample.m, 
written by Daniel Shima.
The mail that Daniel Shima sent, posting the code, is 
<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/psychtoolbox/message/1151"
target="_blank">here</a>, but Yahoogroups doesn't store
attachments any more, so you can download a .zip file
containing the actual code from Allen Ingling's website,
