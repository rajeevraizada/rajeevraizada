<H1> Research goals and current projects </h1>

The question of how people learn has long been central to Cognitive
Neuroscience. However, less attention has been paid to how insights
about learning can be used. How can learning be facilitated, made more
lasting, made more generalisable?
<br>
<br>
Probably the most important type of learning of all is that which
takes place in our schools. For a long time, neuroscience had almost
nothing to say on that topic, but meanwhile a cottage-industry of
"brain-based educators" has tried to sell the latest tricks for
making Junior into a genius.
<br>
<br>
I have been interested for a long time in how insights about learning
can be exploited to improve learning, and at the University of
Washington I have been fortunate to be able to participate in the new
NSF Science of Learning Center, known as the "LIFE" Center (for
Learning in Informal and Formal Environments). This Center is a
collaboration between Stanford, the UW Department of Education, and my
department (the Institute for Learning and Brain Sciences). 


<h1> Current projects </h1>

<h3> The role of the reward system in trial-and-error learning </h3>

The main challenge facing the LIFE Center has been to build solid bridges
between the disparate fields of Education and Cognitive Neuroscience, I have
initiated a study that aims to construct such a bridge.
<br>
<br>
This study, in collaboration with John Bransford, the LIFE Center's
PI, and Prof. Dan Schwartz at Stanford, builds upon two basic
premises, one from education and the other from neuroscience. In
education, it has long been known that that self-guided trial and
error exploration is one of the most powerful forms of learning,
especially in informal settings. In neuroscience, one of the very few
systems whose behaviour can be described in cognitively interpretable
terms is the dopaminergic reward system, which has been shown in
animal and human experiments to encode both predictions and
prediction-errors about whether a given action succeeds or fails. In
my experiment, which is starting up right now, subjects are scanned
using fMRI while they play an interactive game in which each correct
choice brings them closer to solving a problem. The hypothesis is that
the more robustly a subject's dopamine system signals their
trial-by-trial successes and errors, the more quickly they will learn
to solve the problem.
<br>
<br>
If a link is found between dopaminergic signalling and success in the
learning-game, then that would reveal a connection that has not been
shown before. More importantly, the experiment has several possible
implications for education. For example, some people have a tendency
to impede their learning by failing to take account of their mistakes.
Is this because they do not properly encode these mistakes'
occurrence, or is it because they do not attend to the mistakes, even
though their neural reward systems are encoding them robustly? These
two contrasting explanations would require different educational
interventions, and it is the access to internal representations
granted by fMRI that allows them to be pulled apart.


<h3> Environmental influences on neural language processing </h3>

In Pat Kuhl's lab, I have been studying the relationship between brain,
behaviour and the environment in five-year-old children. The children were
given a battery of standardised cognitive and linguistic tests, had their
socioeconomic status assessed using the standard Hollingshead scale, and
underwent fMRI scans while performing a phonological task. These measures
provide a rich data-set for exploring predictive correlations between
linguistic ability and neural activity in the brain's language areas. In
order to statistically correct for these multiple correlation tests, but
without excessive loss of statistical power, I used the recently developed
method of False Discovery Rate correction. A striking result emerged from the
data: the degree of hemispheric specialisation of Broca's area, as measured
by left-minus-right activation during the rhyme task, was found to be
strongly correlated with socioeconomic status. 
<br>
<br>
It is likely that this SES-Broca's link arises via the language 
environments in which the children grow up. Higher SES is correlated
with greater levels of parental education, which in turn leads
to the child being exposed to richer syntax and larger vocabularies.
We collected language samples from the parents, in which they were
recorded reading aloud from a picture book to their children.
We are currently in the process of analysing the transcripts of
these language samples, in order to quantify the complexity of 
syntax and vocabulary. We expect, and will soon know whether the data
shows, that these measures will correlate both with SES and with
Broca's specialisation, thereby providing a possible causal link
between the environment and the brain.
